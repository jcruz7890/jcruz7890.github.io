                2a. The computing innovation i chose is the ps4 pro because want to know how the privacy and how the network works with data.The purpose of ps4 pro is to play games.It works by  a console, to play games  with a software which could let gamers save their data and process.This artifacts shows the purpose of how gamers could save their data and how the ps4 pro console usually works.The ps4 pro have better features and also better to handle.

                2b. I created this artifact by using gimp application, This  application have tools which let me edit my images and texts about the data , benefits about the ps4.The program i used to  create this artifact is gimp which, make me explain a little about the data of the ps4.In also this artifacts show the illustration of what is a ps4 and what harms could be harmful to some gamers. First i did is to research some evidence which contain data and how the ps4 could store some data to save files from games.Then, i did is to decorated my artifacts from google of a ps4, and hard drive which contain the data of the ps4.In finally i used text to show how the ps4 collects data and how the ps4 have good beneficial to some gamers.

                2c. Ps4 pro  innovation does have a software which could let gamers to have a fun experience for example like the best places to play ,graphic,audio,digitality which could download games  inside the software of the ps4 pro.A benefit of ps4 pro is graphics processor (GPU) in the PS4 Pro – that’s the bit that generates the 3D graphics in games – is just over twice as powerful as that in the PS4. Sony’s also upgraded the processor, which handles things like physics and artificial intelligence in games(4).One  potential harm caused by the  ps4 pro  is  when people are playing for more than 12 hours of gaming can  develop pain,deep vein thrombosis , and blood clots that can potentially break free, blocking circulation and causing death(5).A potential harmful effect on society is when  people dont take concern about the ps4 policy, sometimes the ps4 could damage your body or brain cell which may cause pain or totally death. This affects a lot of people because could if people don’t follow the ps4 policy may cause deaths.

                2d. My data my innovation uses is the software because when a user makes a accounts or credit cards info it saved on the data because it connected to the account only(2).It is generated by addingt tv more data like playing games for example  when a gamer plays a game  and dies on the games it restart on your last checkpoint because the save data is saved on your account and always would keep adding more data.My innovation creates data by a games or adding more information in your personal info like buying more games would make the ps4 pro to used data for the new games(2).The data is changed by replacing the data by a new one like when you are doing a process on a game and want to stop playing the ps4 automatically saved the data into the old data almost like a cpu because a ps4 have kinda like cpu which saved the data and makes the changes(2).A concern about privacy is when the ps4 pro have some agreement which make the gamers to saved their data on their account and make them have privacy like the ps4 have some term which have a password or something and also have some different ways to save their data.
