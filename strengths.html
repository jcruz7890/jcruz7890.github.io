<p>this theme describes the  competitive between 2 wine to tell, which wine test more better to drink.In to tell the user which wine to drink more than the other they are drinking on something.This image have 2 wine which are the cause of both of them to compete to the best.</p>
<p>this have affect my life because they have been people who have been compative because they think their re drinking the same wine and to tell which one is more better.In also to tell how other people could be competitive in other thing like in car and games between other people.When people are playing a game they forget they are frends and start to become more revilian.</p>
<p>this strength  could make be more competitive on thing i want to accomplish for example i want to become more superior on math and people think i more better on science and history.but the real thing is i want to become more better on math because to tell the difference between other people and what do they think.</p>

        <p>You have more energy and more goals than other people. You love a sense of accomplishment.You are in a hurry to get started and make things happen because you almost always have a list in your mind of the things you want to get done. It is fun to achieve small goals and even more exciting to achieve big goals that challenge you. The more you get done, the more you feel like a successful person. And the more successes you have, the more you want to have. Finishing a project feels good to you because you love a sense of accomplishment. An award, a good grade, or praise can mean a lot to you because it feels good when your effort and ability are noticed. Because you are a hard worker, you always feel that you could and should be doing more.
</p>
